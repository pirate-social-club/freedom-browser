 *
 * Both V2 (CAIP-2, registered with the `eip155:*` glob) and V1 (legacy
 * string network names) schemes are wired so the client can produce
 * payment payloads against either flavour of x402 server.
 *
 * The schemes receive `@x402/evm`'s `ClientEvmSigner` shape — just
 * `address` + `signTypedData`. No `readContract` etc., so EIP-2612 /
 * ERC-20-approval extensions aren't supported; the base USDC / EIP-3009
 * flow doesn't need them. The address is resolved once at construction —
 * this also resets the vault auto-lock timer, so the typical "build then
 * immediately sign" flow doesn't race the timeout; each signTypedData
 * call re-runs the unlock check in case the vault re-locked.
